## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned even more about how to make a page more responsive.

### Continued development

In the future, I need to keep on using CSS Grid because I'm more familiar with Flexbox so I tend to use it more than Grid. I used both in this project to test myself.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) - As always, Kevin Powell's Youtube channel was helpful, especially regarding CSS Grid.
